- 🤪  Hey my name is Addis Jackson

- 👨‍👨‍👦‍👦 My background is in chemical engineering and education. As a distinguished STEMTEC scholar I am very interested in ways to unfold the more abstract ideas in science in a way that students of all learning types can grasp. What better way to do that than in programable apps and websites that are reactive.

- 👩🏾‍🤝‍🧑🏾👩🏾‍🤝‍🧑🏾I am elated to be a [*Pursuit Fellow*](http://pursuit.org) cohort 10.2 working feverishly to master javascript.

- 💞️  I am hoping I am not alone in this venture and look forward to working with those smarter than I am, and even more committed, to help get science to kids in a more appetizing manner.
 
- 📫  I am easily reached via [**email**](addisjackson@pursuit.org).
